    <h2><i class="fa fa-balance-scale"></i> Ethics</h2>
    <h3>Secrecy</h3>
    <p>We like to share as much as possible about an adventure, except for the details of how to find it and get in. Throwing that information around tends to eventually add difficulty to entering and less enjoyment while inside, because people bring attention and wear. There are basically two ways to learn about a entrance: find it yourself, or be enlightened by someone who trusts you. That seems to have worked pretty well so far, so long as </p>
    <h3>Take Only Pictures</h3>
    <p>We do this for the fun and adventure, not profit. I don't think many people set out exploring in search of loot, so most theft that results is probably simply of opportunity. Whatsoever, it's unacceptable. We don't want people stealing our stuff, so we don't steal theirs. If you still feel inclined to take what isn't yours, let me mention that robbery is much worse than trespassing should you be caught.</p>
    <h3>Leave Only Footprints</h3>
    <p>The two phrases are seperated to emphasize that you don't need to <em>take</em> something from a site to degrade it. Some of the nefarious tomfoolery includes breaking and entering, vandalism, graffiti, municipal and bodily dumping, arsen, et cetera. You get the idea, just respect urban environments with the same respect as other natural environments like the forest.</p>
    <h3>Couth</h3>
    <p>Our ethics didn't feel complete without this one. Just don't be stupid, have some courtesy, and have some fun. <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org/Greg-Brick-Subterranean-Twin-Cities.htm" target="_blank">Don't be a brick</a> and lock up entrances or steal stories. Please don't add to the list of utterly retarded graffiti that we find a lot of (link).</p>
    <h2><i class="fa fa-legal"></i> Politics/Justice</h2>
    <h3>Autonomy</h3>
    <p>The security cameras don't actually have to be operational for the people to act like they are being watched. Look at alcohol and tobacco, some of the worst things for you and they're sold at the store. You could kill yourself so easily with those things, and yet no one wants them illegal. We could all jam forks in our eyeballs and that's not illegal. Yet, the counter arguement is that nobody is really trying to jam forks or jump off bridges for pleasure, and those aren't even really the same to compare. Maybe you shouldn't make an areguement for opening up public spaces because really it's all like drains and caves but still talk a little about the autonomy idea.</p>
    <h3>Minnesota Statutes</h3>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.605" target="_blank">609.605 Trespass</a></h4>
    <p>Goes over the basics, it's pretty self-explanatory.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.6055" target="_blank">609.6055 Trespass on Criical Public Service Facility</a></h4>
    <p>This protects quite a lot of facilites, it mainly applies to drains and bridges for us though. Note the differences between aboveground and underground misdemeanors. Above, you can legally leave when asked to, unless signs are posted or if they've already asked you to leave in the last six months. But below, it's automatically a misdemeanor even without postings. Also, employees of the facility can detain you (link to Ford kidnapping) with reasonable cause, and you can be arrested on probably cause of violation in the preceding four hours.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=97A.315" target="_blank">97A.315 Trespass</a></h4>
    <p>If you knowingly disregard a sign, a personally notification, or commit three misdmemeanors in one year, they turn gross.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=92.70" target="_blank">92.70 Land Use Trespass</a></h4>
    <p>Basically just adds responsibility to pay two or three times any damages, if you're into that.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=97b.001" target="_blank">97B.001 Trespass</a></h4>
    <p>You can retrieve a hunting dog without permission, and you must leave the gate how you found it.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.153" target="_blank">609.153 Increased Penalties for Certain Misdemeanors</a></h4>
    <p>You can get searched, like you didn't know that. Three strikes and you get gross misdemeanors too.</p>

    <p>Max has had quite the experience thus far with life and I highly recommend reading what he had written about it. <em>Teapots Happen</em> is his "synchronicity" blog about all the magical stuff that has happened since <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org/crawlspace1.html" target="_blank">exploring his crawlspace</a>. I find it very interesting.</p>
