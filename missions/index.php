      <h1>Missions</h1>
      <p>These are (almost) all of the adventures that I have been on. They're categorized by the type of feature that they are. Stay on the look out for updates!</p>
      <a href="sample">Sample</a>
        <h2>Drainage Tunnels</h2>
        <p>or just drains</p>
          <h3>West Kitsondale Drain</h3>
          <p>Built in ____, it contains three spiral staircases over ___ft tall, as well as plenty of art. It's about _ miles long</p>
          <h3>East Kitsondale Drain</h3>
          <p>The sibling of the West, this only has one spiral staircase.</p>
          <h3>Old Phalen (VE)</h3>
          <p>It's a hole in the ground that leads to a lot more.</p>
          <h3>Fort Snelling Sewer</h3>
          <p>A sixty foot shaft with a tiny hole at the top tries to kill you.</p>
          <h3>Berg's Drain</h3>
          <p>Finally, just a mild drain under 35W with a chill spot "The Cove" at the end.</p>
        <h2>Underground</h2>
        <p>caves, tunnels that aren't drains...</p>
          <h3>Nicollet Island Tunnels</h3>
          <p>This amazing island has a shit load of tunnels under it.</p>
          <h3>Satan's Cave</h3>
          <p>This is the largest natural cave under Nicolett island, it's where the Satan lives.</p>
          <h3>Santa's Cave</h3>
          <p>Perhaps the two characters share more in common than being anagrams. Anyways, this is the smaller sibling cave to Satan's.</p>
          <h3>Echo Cave</h3>
          <p>It's used as bat sanctuary now, but you might still be able to get in.</p>
          <h3>Ford Gas Tunnel</h3>
          <p>It's a long tunnel with dead racoons and pretty good flowstone at the end, also a ladder into a construction site.</p>
          <h3>Mile's Cave</h3>
          <p>This is the only one I haven't actually been to.</p>
          <h3>Lee Mill Cave</h3>
          <p>In Spring Lake Park, this small natural cave sits high on the bluff.</p>
        <h2>Aboveground</h2>
        <p>buildings, bridges...</p>
          <h3>Ford Building</h3>
          <p>Half wastewater treatment, half steam production, you just have to find a way in.</p>
          <h3>Bryn Mawr Mill</h3>
          <p>Some crazies chased us out of the basement.</p>
          <h3>U-More Water Tower</h3>
          <p>Scariest shit ever I thought the cops would come the whole time.</p>
          <h3>Vermillion Falls Mill Cavern</h3>
          <p>A little opening in the corner of a building near Vermillion Falls, turns out to be the tailrace to an old mill.</p>
