    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <h3>First-Aid</h3>
    <p>Just something basic can be well appreciated if you happen to hurt yourself.<br>https://www.amazon.com/Small-First-Aid-Kit-Piece/dp/B00LPQUWPG/</p>
    <h3>Respirator / Gas + Oxygen Detector</h3>
    <p>Some are more paranoid than others about this.<br>https://www.amazon.com/3M-8511-Particulate-Respirator-10-Pack/dp/B0002YKBV2<br>look into what airborne contaminants are present and what types of filters are effective<br>https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-PNG2000A-Natural-Detector/dp/B001KZH796</p>
    <p>There are other ways to know if the air has enough oxygen though. Try to light a flame, or see if the air is stale.</p>
    <h3>Friends</h3>
    <p>They're not only for company; it's a lot safer to have atleast two other people with you if one gets hurt, one can leave for help while one stays with the wounded.</p>
    <p>Let someone know where to look for you in case you think you could be stranded somehow.</p>
    <h3>Shoes/Gloves</h3>
    <p>Make sure to protect yourself from the ground, these can also keep your feet dry if they have to. Extra socks can come in handy if your primaries get soaked. I don't think there is any health dangers with walking through nasty water, but I'm not sure, you could try to wear crocs or something too instead of rain boots.</p>
    <p>rain boots, fivefinger shoes, crocs</p>
    <p>these just come in handy and protect you</p>
    <p>jacket, gloves</p>
    <h3>Luminescence</h3>
    <p>I pretty much always have a flashlight. Even if you're not going underground, most buildings have basements and closets in which it comes in handy.</p>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Camera</h3>
    <p>If you want to be all camera enthusiastic, go for it. Otherwise your phone can usually suffice, or a cheap action camera.</p>
    <h3>Drone</h3>
    <h3>More Luminescence</h3>
    <p>Double down on the electrons if you want a halfway decent shot in any classic dark underground environment.</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <h2>Art</h2>

    <h3>Distance Measurement</h3>
    <p>A laser rangefinder works, or a tape measure, or hands.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>For drawing maps of the place, I like this shit:</p>
    <h3><s>Paint</s></h3>
    <p>I mean, publicly I have to say don't do it. But if you're good at it...</p>
    <h3>Steel Wool</h3>
    <p>You light in on fire and spin it around, while your camera is exposed.</p>
    <h3>Lasers</h3>
    <p>They can look pretty cool.</p>
    <h2>Artifacts/Encounters</h2>
    <p>all the shit we found over the years like cats and bats</p>
    <h2>Grotto Gear</h2>
