      <h2><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Conception</h2>
<p>Basically, the spark to dive deeper into urban exploration came after having an exhilarating time exploring a mill in Minneapolis. We climbed high to the rooftops and got chased out of the dark basement by some maniacal laughing bums (link story). A friend also told be what he heard about "the labyrinth" of utility tunnels underneath downtown St. Paul. So I researched all I could for more sites to check out and discovered the few explorers of the Twin Cities, most notably Action Squad. I was entertained reading their trips and seeing their photos, they'd been in every place I knew of and many more. Something was missing from the urbex scene though, most publications stopped atleast a few years ago and seemed half-finished, like there was more to get around to that never did. I can understand in the 90's that photos were the best medium but now there are cheap videocameras like the Yi or even smartphones that can capture HD footage. Although explorers have always been here and maybe are even increasing recently, I saw the hayday remaining in the time of Action Squad. Nobody had yet matched their unique personality and storytelling.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Operation</h2>
<p>I prefaced the previous with "basically" because there's a lot of other parameters falling into place to make an explorer. Max Action puts it well, "the motivations behind Action Squad are complicated and no doubt the result of seeing 'Goonies' and the Indiana Jones movies too many times at too impressionable of an age". For me it went from following creeks through the woods, biking roads as far as they go, and sneaking through quarries to infiltrating tunnels and old buildings. Though really, anyone with an open mind could find the natural enjoyment from urban exploration. To quote Max again, "creatures were sometimes killed for their curiosity; however, the many that did not die often proved much more adept at locating vital resources for survival than those creatures that allowed their fears to keep them locked into the same safe routines and spaces". So while we're not actually looking for food to survive, urban exploration activates this thrill of ours and we can do it for fun, like cannabinoids activating endocannabinoid receptors.</p>
<p>There is a great loss we have accrued by paving roads and farms accross the country, and declaring it owned by someone. It was said by the European discoverers of this continent that a squirrel could jump tree to tree and make it from one coast to the other. That was the stuff of original exploration, who needs progress when you have wilderness like that? Alas, with the world charted, ironically the very force that eliminated exploration has brought back another opportunity for it with derelict abandonments, highrise rooftops, and massive stormwater drains... cue explorers.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Expansion</h2>
<p>In the unforseeable future when I imagine my Twin Cities' adventure will run out, I'll have to expand to new destinations for my exploration fix. Right now I'm just sitting on the queue of exploring sites that I've amassed, slowly working through them. Filmore County holds many caves just over the horizon in Southern Minnesota. It may lead to Iowa's caves or beyond to Mammoth Cave and others around there. There'll always be cities with drains and structures to stumble into as well anyways. Getting under a larger city like Chicago might be interesting. The whole world is beyond, who knows what I'll end up getting into.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> Thanks</h2>
<p>Of course here's where I'd say we're all the same and all that but I especially acknowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you</li>
  <li>friends</li>
  <li>abandoners</li>
  <li>tunnel diggers</li>
  <li>geologic processes</li>
</ul>
