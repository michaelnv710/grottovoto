  <h2><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Conception</h2>
  <p>I started this site to entertain you with urban exploration, because I thought the world wanted something like it. I had admired <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org">Action Squad</a>'s stories, and other explorers were as exciting to read, but they were mostly that – reading. Media was almost always still photography, and I got the feeling something more could be made from the exotic visuals. Many sites had broken links to other explorers or seemed abandoned too, and even a lof of the best like Action Squad had hung up the coat, so maybe anyways I could reinspire lost enthusiasm with something new.</p>
  <p>Exploration was always a hobby of mine, probably just like anyone else who shares the curiosity. As a kid, I rode my bike to new reaches, traversed local woods, got into quarries on the weekend. Wilderness became my first choice, but finding new places makes itself increasingly difficult, not to mention all of the space civilization takes up. It's hardly worth it, but one opporunity emerges from this civilization: exploring its abandonments, drainage tunnels</p>
  <p>My real motives probably seeded way back in the formative years, but I remember it starting in 2014 when a friend mentioned "The Labyrinth" of utility tunnels under downtown St. Paul. I was intrigued and soon discovered <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org">Action Squad</a>'s Urban Exploration from all over the Twin Cities. Reading their stories, I felt like Max Action <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org/sitehistory.htm">when <em>he</em> found</a> other local exploring websites; but he'd been exploring for five years already while I was just about to begin.

  <p>I would've had to suffice with caves and nature all along if it wasn't for the plot of our planet.</p>
  <h2><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Operation</h2>
  <p>They said a squirrel could jump tree to tree coast to coast when the Europeans reached North America, now you can do it six ways to sunday on a wheelchair, without touching any earth. Hunting and gethering took estimates of up to 20 hours of labor a week per person, and now our farming makes more food than we would ever need and yet there is an inbalnce of wealth, some are obese while others starve.</p>
  <p>talk about trees having been replaced by pavement, no more exploration except what's under and around us</p>
  <p>Max Action articulated well in his essay <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org/ramble01.html">The Past, Present, & Future of Urban Exploration</a></p>
  <p>Right now I'm exploring and documenting as much as I can here. There are plenty of leads  places to look, I've even been to a few places already, it's just a matter of getting </p>
  <h2><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Expansion</h2>
  <p>In the unforseeable future when I imagine my Twin Cities' adventure will run out, I think I'll expand to new destinations. Filmore County is just over the horizon in Southern Minnesota, where there are many caves. It could lead me to Iowa's caves or perhaps beyond to Mammoth Cave and others in that area. Surely along the way there'll be cities with drains and structures to stumble into as well. Getting under a larger city like Chicago might be interesting. The whole world is beyond, who knows what I'll end up getting into.</p>
