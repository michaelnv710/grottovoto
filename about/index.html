      <h2><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Conception</h2>
      <p>My real motives probably seeded way back in the formative years, but I remember this all pretty much starting in 2014 when a friend mentioned "The Labyrinth" of utility tunnels underneath downtown St. Paul. I was intrigued and soon discovered <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org">Action Squad</a>'s Urban Exploration legend from all over the Twin Cities. "I think they have a website or something" was my friend's underestimation of their multitude of adventures over the years. Reading them, I felt like Max Action <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org/sitehistory.htm">when <em>he</em> found</a> other local exploring websites; but he'd been exploring for five years already while I was just about to begin.</p>
      <p>People don't usually just publish how to enter a location <a href="../culture">(nor should they)</a>, but cross-reference, intuition, and plain exploration is usually enough to find plenty of adventure. After scouring every resource I could find, I believe I now have a map of most Urban Exploration in the Twin Cities. Meanwhile, it seemed that quite a few Minnesota exploration websites from the past weren't in action anymore, what happened to <a class="text-muted" href="http://frozencrystal.wattbuddy.com/">The Frozen Crystal Underground</a>, <a class="text-muted" href="http://www.municipalheroes.com/">Municipal Heroes</a>, <a class="text-muted"  href="http://www.hollow-hills.com/">Hollow Hills</a>, <a class="text-muted" href="http://suenm.kirkbridebuildings.com/">The Secret Urban Exploration Ninja Mafia</a>? There were few who were consistent and organized enough like Action Squad to be most entertaining, but even they haven't updated anything for a while, and relied more on text than media.</p>
      <p>So I thought, there's something missing here. I bet people would love to see some HD footage of all the sorts of things Urban Explorers get into. I've been to a few places already and the model seems to have worked well so far, so here I am.</p>
      <h2><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Operation</h2>
      <p>I'm sort of the mastermind of it all, but my friends are equally important. We try to capture the art in these places as best we can. Usually the location is known but sometimes we go looking for it. The first time through is just for exploration, then we go back for art and documentation, already knowing where to spend our time. We stick to our <a href="/culture">ethics</a> and have fun, it's also great exercise.</p>
      <p>talk about trees having been replaced by pavement, no more exploration except what's under and around us</p>
