      <p>I probably wouldn't have made this site if there was already something like it out there already. Action Squad was and still is excellent to read, but nobody ever really improved upon it. It seemed like every other exploring site I visited (mind you only of the Twin Cities based groups) had an element of haphazardness to it. The content wasn't bad, but I felt like every one was just documented their exploration instead of going in with the intention of documenting it as well as possible.[It also seemed like every single place had at least one place that said "more coming soon", it was just not professional.] There were only action crews, no camera crews. Now, the action's still got to be there, but we're going to get a good shot first.</p>
      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>For me, this all started when a friend of mine mentioned "The Labyrinth" of utility tunnels underneath downtown St. Paul. Naturally, the conversation turned to Action Squad and the exploration they had done in the late 90's and early 00's. I was lead to their <a href="http://www.actionsquad.org">website</a> and I read it like a book you can't put down. I was excited and inspired to do the same exploring that they had done, in the dark, underground, where you shouldn't be. So I researched as much as I could, I found everything that appears on <a href="../culture"><em>culture</em></a> and more, you'd be suprised at how much you can find when you dig. </p>
